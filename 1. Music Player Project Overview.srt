1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,650
All righty.

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:03,750
Welcome to the project.

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,330
So I'm very excited about this one.

4
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,490
We are creating a music player.

5
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:14,280
I've always been interested in music players on computers for the past 20 years or so.

6
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:19,110
Going back to my Winamp days, shout out to anybody that knows what Winamp is.

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:27,540
And today we're going to be making our own music player within our HDMI, LCROSS and JavaScript.

8
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,980
We can see that we are showing some album artwork here.

9
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,420
We have the title of the song.

10
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,950
We have the artists of the song.

11
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,320
We have the current time.

12
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,450
We have the total duration of the song.

13
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,580
We have a play button here.

14
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:46,680
We have a next button and a previous button will go over the functionality.

15
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:47,620
Now, one by one.

16
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,700
So of course, we want to be able to play a song and pause a song as well.

17
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,810
We want to be able to go to the next song.

18
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:00,810
So you can see that the album artwork has changed.

19
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,510
And the title has changed.

20
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:05,510
And the duration of the song has changed.

21
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:09,800
And you can see as we play that the current time is increasing.

22
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:16,140
And if we play this song, we can actually scrub through by clicking on the progress bar.

23
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:26,320
And we can also use the next to loop through our songs indefinitely.

24
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:31,560
And the previous to go back through our songs and definitely so we'll always have music playing.

25
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,440
And now previous.

26
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:46,140
OK.

27
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:46,840
Perfect.

28
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:51,370
So we have an idea of the core functionality that we trying to achieve.

29
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:55,930
Now we're going to break it down one at a time and get everything done.

30
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,100
All right.

31
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:58,430
Let's get started.
