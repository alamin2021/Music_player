1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:07,950
All righty, so let's finish up our UI and that's going to be adding our own progress, bar and button

2
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:08,700
controls.

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,030
So we're gonna start with the progress bar.

4
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:16,090
So let's jump back over to our code in our H.T. Amelle.

5
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:19,260
We're going to create this underneath our song.

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,640
We're going to add in title here, progress.

7
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:32,460
And we're gonna start with a div with the class of progress, stasch container and the I.D. as well

8
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,620
of progress stasch container.

9
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:43,050
And inside of this, we're gonna create another div with the class of progress and the idea of progress.

10
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:48,690
So this container is going to be what holds our progress bar.

11
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:53,550
And this is the actual bar that's gonna change sizes as we're going through the song.

12
00:00:54,450 --> 00:01:04,140
And we also are going to have a div that is going to hold our duration as well as our current time.

13
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:09,720
So we're gonna make Span's for that and we're gonna provide an I.D..

14
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:16,190
Of current dash time, and for right now, we're just going to hardcoded.

15
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:22,400
So it'll be zero zero zero and we're going to create another span.

16
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:25,910
And this one is going to be for our duration.

17
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:31,490
And this one I know off the top of my head that it's two minutes and six seconds.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,930
You can even actually see that within our audio controls here.

19
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:38,330
So we're just hard coding that value.

20
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:39,430
OK.

21
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,880
So let's save that and check it out.

22
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:43,750
OK.

23
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:46,540
So you can see that all of the styling work is done for us.

24
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:47,380
That's nice.

25
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:53,080
And we have our project container here and we have our actual progress here.

26
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:54,820
And you know what?

27
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:00,550
Let's actually hide the controls because we want to actually build out the rest of our UI and see how

28
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:01,570
it's actually going to look.

29
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,520
So let's do that.

30
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:05,680
Let's just get rid of these controls for now.

31
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:09,820
So the next time we'll control our audio will be through our JavaScript.

32
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:15,430
And if we jump into the sea, assess here, we can see that we do have.

33
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,140
Our styling.

34
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,970
All done for our progress container.

35
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,920
You can see that we're using border radius again on both of these.

36
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,600
This is the background color.

37
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,830
This is the dark color.

38
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:30,150
And you can see that we already have a width here of sixty six percent.

39
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:37,140
So this is going to be changed dynamically in our JavaScript when our song is playing to show exactly

40
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,520
how far through the song we are.

41
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:42,780
But for now, it's just a static value of sixty six percent.

42
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:47,070
OK, so let's save that and jump back.

43
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:50,550
OK, so that's more what our UI is actually going to look like.

44
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:56,700
And you can see we have a space here that is a space for our button controls.

45
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,300
So let's jump into that next.

46
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:03,140
Back in the code, we can see at the top of our H.

47
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:09,300
T Amelle, if we use our word wrap Alte Z, we can see that we're already importing font awesome into

48
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:09,930
our project.

49
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,480
So you don't need to worry about that part.

50
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:19,110
But if you want to know how to add different icons, I'm just going to go back briefly to the font awesome

51
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,530
Web site and I'll provide this link within the course.

52
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,540
But you can see that we have a number of different icons here and you can search.

53
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,660
So let's say that I want to search for a play button.

54
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,120
This is the button that we're gonna use.

55
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:37,230
But let's say that you wanted to use a play circle button instead.

56
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,280
You could click on that.

57
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:43,550
So any icon that you click on, you can see that you can actually copy the H.

58
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,390
T Amelle for the icon.

59
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,440
And that's how you would add it into your project.

60
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:53,430
OK, so let's jump back to our HD, UML and make our buttons.

61
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:57,810
So we're gonna go below our progress section here.

62
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,060
We're going to comment out another title.

63
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:09,300
And this is going to be for our controls and we're going to start by creating a div again that will

64
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,620
act as a parent element.

65
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:15,030
This allows us to really control the placement on the page.

66
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:19,320
And we're going to go ahead and make each of our icons here.

67
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:24,660
So we're going to use AI is our element.

68
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:28,450
And we're going to use the classes of F.A.A. s.

69
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,920
So that stands for fun.

70
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:30,480
Awesome.

71
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,140
Solid.

72
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,500
And then I can add another class by adding another period.

73
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,560
In this case, we're going to do our previous button first.

74
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:40,530
And that is F.A.A. dash backward.

75
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:48,690
And we're also going to give it an I.D. so we can keep stacking these an I.D. of previous.

76
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,860
But I'm just gonna put PreÅ¡ov and we can press enter there.

77
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,310
And lastly, I'm actually going to also add a title.

78
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:02,120
So that when we hover over it, we can see exactly the functionality of that icon.

79
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:07,900
OK, so I can paste this twice more.

80
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,860
And we're going to change this.

81
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:13,510
This is going to be our play button.

82
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,010
So just f a play.

83
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:21,250
I'm actually gonna give this another class main dash button because I want this button to be bigger

84
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:22,240
than the other two.

85
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,060
And and change the idea to play.

86
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:27,190
And the title of this.

87
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,390
Well, to play.

88
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:33,010
And the last button is going to be forward.

89
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:38,920
So we're just going to change that to forward and we're going to change this next.

90
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:42,790
And our title will also be next.

91
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:44,950
OK, so let's save that.

92
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,240
And next, we're going to jump into the CSX.

93
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:54,970
So if we scroll down, we can see that again, we have some styling included already, including the

94
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:57,910
position of our player controls and the width and everything.

95
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:02,140
And you can see that we're targeting the FAA s class.

96
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:04,150
So that's the main class.

97
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:05,980
It's on all three of our icons.

98
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:13,060
And we're controlling the size with font Dasch size because essentially it acts as a font, even though

99
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:13,780
it's an icon.

100
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:21,280
But there are two very specific classes that we want to have if we are going to use an icon as a button.

101
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:27,400
So if we just jump over right now to our project, we can see that these look great.

102
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:32,440
But when I hover over them, there's no sign that I can actually do anything with them.

103
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:38,910
So what we're gonna do first is we're gonna add in curser pointer.

104
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:41,110
You can see it auto completes if I press tab.

105
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:45,200
And the next thing we're going to add is user select none.

106
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,130
You can see if we press tab twice, it will auto complete.

107
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:53,650
So that's to prevent it from being selected like any other font could be selected.

108
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:57,640
OK, so let's save that and check it out.

109
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:01,830
So I was talking about this is like user select because this is a font.

110
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,920
We don't want that to happen.

111
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:09,490
And so you can see that when we hover over now, not only do we have our titles, which is great, we

112
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:14,380
have the cursor change to a glove, just like it would with a regular button.

113
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:20,560
It's still maybe could be a little more clear when we're hovering over it that it's ready to be clicked.

114
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:24,250
And we can do that by changing the color of the button.

115
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,710
And we can do that in a very quick way.

116
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:34,000
So below this, we're going to target our F ace class and we're gonna use a pseudo class hover.

117
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:41,050
So this class will only be initiated when it's being hovered over with the mouse and we're gonna use

118
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:45,820
filter brightness and 80 percent.

119
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:52,780
So that means that our buttons will become 20 percent darker as they're being hovered over.

120
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:55,530
So let's jump back and check that out.

121
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:01,810
OK, so I think that that's a little bit more of a dramatic difference when we're hovering over the

122
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:02,320
button.

123
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:03,670
Perfect.

124
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,740
Feels a lot more interactive.

125
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,010
All right.

126
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:11,260
So that's pretty much it for our UI in the next one.

127
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,570
We'll get started on our functionality.

128
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,130
I've seen that one.

129
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:16,450
Bye for now.
