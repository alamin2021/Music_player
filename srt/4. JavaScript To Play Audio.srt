1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:07,070
All righty, so we have a lot of different functionality to get to, but we're going to start with the

2
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:12,150
most basic first, and that is our play pause functionality.

3
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:18,380
You might remember that when we had our controls for our audio within here, though, we already had

4
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:21,320
that ability to play and pause our audio track.

5
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:25,610
We're going to need to transfer that ability to our custom icon here.

6
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:32,390
So first, we're gonna look at a resource that talks about audio and video dom elements.

7
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:36,470
You can see that we have different methods, properties and events.

8
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:41,630
And in this case, we don't have to scroll very far because we're interested in the methods here.

9
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,440
We can see that we have a play method and we have a pause method.

10
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:47,300
That's pretty self-explanatory.

11
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:52,370
So we're going to need to trigger these on our audio element.

12
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:55,370
So let's jump back to our code.

13
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:01,050
We're gonna start in our JavaScript and we're going to need to target.

14
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,350
A few different things, so we're going to target our audio element because we want to be able to control

15
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:07,650
that.

16
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,870
And we're also going to be targeting our buttons because that's what's going to allow us to actually

17
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:13,500
control.

18
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:20,100
So you can see we have ideas for these, but the audio element doesn't have an I.D. So that's because

19
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:22,770
we can reference this in different way.

20
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:25,290
Let's make a constant.

21
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:34,000
Called music for audio element, and this is going to be equal to document query selector.

22
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,580
The bottom line here, I'll scroll down and press enter.

23
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:44,320
And so this allows us to select an element or a class or an I.D., anything we want to pass in there.

24
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:50,110
So in this case, because we only have one audio element, we can use this to select that.

25
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:54,220
And below that, we're going to create constants for our buttons.

26
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:57,370
So we're gonna call Prešov B10 for our button.

27
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:02,310
And that's going to equal document dot get element by I.D..

28
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:07,110
And this is are Prešov I.D. that we added on their.

29
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:16,200
And I'm just going to actually copy and paste this to more times, and in this case, we can use our

30
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:24,810
select, which is our command DS or control DS, depending on if you're Mac or Windows.

31
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:28,260
And you can see we've selected both, there's a cursor on each.

32
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,860
And I'm going to use that to change that, to play.

33
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:36,420
And I'm going to do the same thing with this and change that to.

34
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,020
All right, perfect.

35
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:42,240
So we're done selecting our elements.

36
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:48,060
Next, we're gonna need to make functions for our play pause functionality.

37
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,540
We're going to do that below.

38
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,690
So we're going to start by commenting on a title.

39
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,250
Play an organ and create a function called play song.

40
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:05,580
We're going to make this different than just play, because we already have that method within the audio

41
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,570
element itself.

42
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,610
Now we're going to target the constant four audio element, which we're calling music, and we're just

43
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,550
going to pass in the method of play.

44
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:18,630
And we're gonna do a similar thing with our paws.

45
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:24,960
So I'm actually going to copy this paste below and change this.

46
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:28,060
I'll highlight both of these and change them at once.

47
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:28,380
OK.

48
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:29,950
And they're both paws.

49
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:39,030
Next, we're going to need to trigger play if the music is paused or pause if the music is playing already.

50
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:45,520
So to do that, we're gonna need to add in a boolean that we're gonna set within each of these functions

51
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:48,370
to show whether it is playing or not.

52
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,500
So we're gonna commentate a title above.

53
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:52,390
Check if playing.

54
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:55,840
And we're going to let is playing.

55
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:59,420
It's the name of our boolean equal false.

56
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,680
And when we're playing a song.

57
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,180
Is playing is going to be true.

58
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:11,370
When we are paused, is playing is going to be equal to.

59
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:12,940
False.

60
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:19,650
And when we first load the page is playing is going to be false because it won't start playing until

61
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:20,910
you hit the play button.

62
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:25,550
Next, we're gonna go over our event listener functionality.

63
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:33,860
So based on whether is playing is true or false, we're gonna want to launch the opposite function.

64
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,420
If it's playing, we want to pause.

65
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:41,000
If it's we want to play, we can accomplish this with a ternary operator.

66
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,550
So this is similar to an if statement.

67
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,890
For those of you unfamiliar.

68
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,390
This is the syntax.

69
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:51,020
We're gonna provide a condition in this case.

70
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,880
We want to check if the is playing boolean is true or false.

71
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:58,910
And then we have an expression if true.

72
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,810
And then we have Colen and then expression if false.

73
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,870
In this case, we're gonna run a certain function.

74
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:09,950
If this is true and a different function if it's false.

75
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,750
So let's set that up.

76
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:15,780
We're going to add an event listener below our functions.

77
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:22,230
And we'll call it the play or pause event listener.

78
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:31,000
And on our play button, we're going to add an event listener and we're going to add a click event,

79
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:36,820
comma, and we're going to use an arrow function instead of making a separate function for this.

80
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:41,260
So we're going to have brackets, equal sign creator arrow here.

81
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,670
We can actually add our ternary operator on the same line.

82
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:54,290
So we're going to add in another bracket here for that operator is playing and then space questionmark.

83
00:05:54,550 --> 00:06:02,650
So if it's true now, we want to pause the song and then brackets to show that we're launching the function

84
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:09,010
and then we're gonna have a colon and then we're gonna have play song, the other function, and we're

85
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:11,800
going to have another set of brackets for that function.

86
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,410
And we'll put a semicolon at the end here.

87
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,190
So just to clarify, these brackets are for that function.

88
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,520
This other bracket is for the ternary operator.

89
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,120
And this last bracket is for the entire event listener.

90
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:26,440
All right.

91
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,640
So let's save that and we can finally check it out.

92
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,120
OK, awesome.

93
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,440
We have some music playing.

94
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,430
That is great.

95
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:42,900
The one thing you might notice, though, is that the play button stayed a play button.

96
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:49,540
We actually want the play button to turn into a pause button if the music's playing and vice versa.

97
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,220
So we'll need to add that within our code.

98
00:06:54,430 --> 00:07:00,860
So if we go into our play functionality first, below are is playing bullion.

99
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,900
We are going to target our play button.

100
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:13,660
Class list and we're going to replace this allows us to do this on one line instead of an add and remove

101
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:14,830
on two separate lines.

102
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:19,700
And we want to replace the class F a dash play.

103
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:26,440
That's what it will start out with when the page loads with F.A. Dash pause.

104
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:31,940
So when it's playing, we want to show the pause icon and vice versa.

105
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,110
We'll copy that and we'll put that into our pores.

106
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,620
But we're gonna flip these, so we're gonna replace.

107
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:51,360
The pause with the play icon in this case and the last thing we'll do is we actually want to change

108
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,200
the title.

109
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:54,720
So you remember that we set the title of play.

110
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,590
We can do that by using the set attribute method.

111
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:07,080
And in this, we're going to set the title attribute, comma, and then we're gonna set it with pause

112
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:14,070
so that when we hover over, it will also say pause and won't say play over the pause icon and we'll

113
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:14,820
copy that.

114
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:16,770
Pasted in here.

115
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,980
And this time we want the title to be play.

116
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,700
All right, so let's save that and check it out.

117
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:29,080
OK, so we can see that we have our play icon here and it says Play.

118
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:35,290
And if we click on it, we can see that we had our Porres icon there.

119
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,070
That's awesome.

120
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:38,440
And if we hover over the pause icon.

121
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,210
We can see that it's his paws.

122
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:45,500
All right, awesome.

123
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:50,120
We have our play and paws functionality sorted out in the next one.

124
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:53,900
We're going to start looking at our previous and next functionality.

125
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:55,520
I'll see in that one.

126
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,750
Bye for now.
