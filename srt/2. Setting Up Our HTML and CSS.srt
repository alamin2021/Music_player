1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:07,950
All righty, so to start with, there is a template zip file within the course that you should be downloading.

2
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,060
And once you've unzipped it, you'll have a folder like this.

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,510
And what I would suggest you do is rename it.

4
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:21,030
So I'm going to remove the template part and just have it called Music Dasch player, just to show that

5
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:27,570
I'm working on the project now and we're going to open this folder up within Visual Studio Code.

6
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:34,860
OK, so you can see in our sidebar here that we have two extra folders in addition to our three standard

7
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:35,370
files.

8
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,620
The first one is an image folder.

9
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:40,710
So these are just images that I pulled from on Splash.

10
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:47,050
I'm going to provide a link to the creator of these images within the CSX file.

11
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,330
And I've also included MP three files in a music folder.

12
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:54,060
You'll notice that they have the same names.

13
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:59,370
That's to make it easier in our JavaScript to call these items.

14
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,080
And you might notice that these songs actually have my name on them.

15
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,560
So these are actually music files that I have produced.

16
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:13,290
I've been making music since I was 16 years old and I thought it'd be cool to throw some into the project.

17
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:14,260
All right.

18
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,500
So let's open up our H.T. email, our CSX and our JavaScript files.

19
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,760
And then I'm going to hide the sidebar just to make some more room on our page here.

20
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:25,230
All right.

21
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:30,480
So the first thing we're gonna do is just launch our project with our live server extension.

22
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:35,710
OK, so we can see that we already have a background color on our body.

23
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,750
You can feel free to change this.

24
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:42,850
But the overall theme I'm going for with this project is a modern craze style.

25
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:49,180
So therefore, I've included some CSX within the template to make things a little bit easier so we can

26
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,920
focus more on the JavaScript.

27
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:56,630
So let's jump back to our H.T. mill and start actually building out our project.

28
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:03,200
So the first thing that we're going to include is we're going to actually make a div that's going to

29
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:11,480
contain our entire player so that we have the ability to move it around on the page so we can use the

30
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,970
auto complete within visual studio code.

31
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:19,220
So div dot player, dash container and press enter.

32
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,460
And that gives us a div with the class player container.

33
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,670
And within this we're going to comment on the title.

34
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:29,870
We're going to add in our song properties here.

35
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:38,540
So the first thing is we're going to create a div with the class of AMG dash container for our image

36
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,660
and we're going to put an image inside of that.

37
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:46,850
And the source for this image will be our image folder slash.

38
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:49,280
And then you can see it auto completes for us.

39
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:55,040
We're gonna go with the first one, Jacinto Dash one dot jpeg, of course, for your project.

40
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:59,330
If you want to change the audio and the images, you can feel free to.

41
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,190
You just want to put in whatever names will correspond to the files you've included.

42
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:08,450
And for our all tech, we're just going to put in album art.

43
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:13,930
And below this, we're going to add in the title.

44
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:20,070
For our songs, we're going to have an H two and we're going to add an I.D. of title.

45
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:25,700
And I'm going to just put in the information that I know it is for the first song.

46
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:31,700
You do the same thing, just put in whatever the song name is that you have in this case.

47
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:32,750
This is the example.

48
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:41,420
I can use the hashtag here to add an idea quicker way so I can have an H three now with the idea of

49
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,050
artist.

50
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:48,560
So this is going to be a little bit smaller and I have the artist here and the last thing I'm going

51
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,050
to add is the actual audio element itself, which is of course very important.

52
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:57,170
So we can type audio and press tab.

53
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:00,380
The source is going to be our music folder.

54
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:02,600
And again, we're gonna go with the first one.

55
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:04,820
Jacinto Desh one, MP three.

56
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:07,100
And I'm going to take it a step further.

57
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:13,130
And I'm temporarily going to add controls just so that we can actually see the element on the page.

58
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:14,270
All right.

59
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,620
So let's save that and check it out.

60
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:18,710
OK.

61
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:20,160
So we have our image here.

62
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,780
And if we scroll down, we have our title.

63
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,640
We have our artist.

64
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,860
And we even have our audio element here.

65
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:32,400
So the good thing about using controls is that it actually enables us to use the audio.

66
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:37,410
So you can see that we have a play pause button.

67
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,550
We have the current time.

68
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:39,570
We have the duration.

69
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:46,590
These are things that we are going to recreate ourselves using custom elements that are going to provide

70
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:47,910
the same information.

71
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,540
Let's get back to the styling, though.

72
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:56,880
The next thing that is a huge thing that can be changed and customized is, of course, the fonts.

73
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:02,580
So we're going to use Google fonts for that because it's the quickest, easiest way to do it.

74
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:06,840
So on the Web site, you can choose any font that you would like.

75
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:10,260
I have a specific font in mind, so I'm going to search for it.

76
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,280
It's called Spartan.

77
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:16,830
So whenever you click on a font that you would like, it goes into a detail view for that font.

78
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:21,300
And I know that I actually want two different font weights here.

79
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,270
So I want the regular swinging to click select this style.

80
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:27,510
And I also want a bold version as well.

81
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:30,660
So I'm going to click select this style as well.

82
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,880
So I want two different font weights here to add it to the project.

83
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:43,350
We're just gonna click embed and we specifically want the import statement and we're just going to copy

84
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:43,980
this.

85
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,650
And we're going to jump back into our CSX.

86
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,530
So, you see, this is the credit for the images that I'm using here.

87
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,940
Feel free to check out his work.

88
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:57,990
He has a lot of great stuff on UN Splash and right below that.

89
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:00,970
I'm going to add in our import statement for our font.

90
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:07,050
And then within the body can see we already have some styling here.

91
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,960
I'm going to add in the font family and it's going to be Spartan comma.

92
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:19,080
I'm going to add sun dash surf just as a backup in case it doesn't load.

93
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,510
OK, so let's save that.

94
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,570
Jump back and check it out.

95
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:25,710
OK.

96
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,980
I would say that that font looks a whole lot better.

97
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,180
Awesome.

98
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:35,470
Next, we're gonna move on to actually styling our player container.

99
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:39,600
So you can see right now that the image is as big as it wants to be.

100
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:46,860
But we want the image to be a certain size and we want the container that's holding that image to also

101
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,830
be much smaller than this currently is.

102
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:56,070
So let's jump back to our CSX and right below our body.

103
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:59,340
We're going to start styling for our player container.

104
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:04,990
So this was the first d'Hiv that we created.

105
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:09,190
We're going to start with giving it a certain size.

106
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:17,320
So I'm going to give it a height of five hundred pixels and I'm going to give it a width of 400 pixels.

107
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:23,680
So the reason I want it to be 400 is because most smartphones, large smartphones, I should say.

108
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:31,230
So I have the S 20 plus, for example, their screen width is just a little bit over 400 pixels.

109
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:35,590
So this will be able to fit on that screen without any kind of media queries.

110
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,140
OK.

111
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,940
And the next thing is we want to create a background color.

112
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:46,760
For this, so the next thing is we want to have a background color.

113
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:49,580
That's just a little bit lighter than our body background color.

114
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:53,060
So I'm actually in a copy this again.

115
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:55,460
You can choose whatever colors you would like.

116
00:07:56,390 --> 00:08:02,030
But what I'm gonna do is I'm actually going to use something that's very handy within Visual Studio

117
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:02,510
Code.

118
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:04,520
And that is the color picker.

119
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:11,300
So you see, if I hover over it, it opens up the color picker and I can just kind of decide to pick

120
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:12,170
a lighter color.

121
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,930
So we want it to be lighter.

122
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:17,000
I think that's a good color there.

123
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,290
OK, perfect.

124
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:20,720
So keep in mind, you can do a similar thing.

125
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:25,670
You can select a background color and use the color picker to just pick a lighter version.

126
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:26,720
All right.

127
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,910
So let's save that and check it out.

128
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:30,020
OK.

129
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,090
So we can see that we have our container here.

130
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:34,040
We see our image is still way too big.

131
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:38,270
But I like the way that this gray works with this gray.

132
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:39,540
OK.

133
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:45,740
Now I'm going to show you two properties that you can use that will instantly make whatever you're working

134
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:45,980
on.

135
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:47,180
Look more modern.

136
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:51,680
So the first one is border radius.

137
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:57,680
So this is having the ability to add rounded corners to any element.

138
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:02,420
So in this case, I'm going to add a border radius of 20 pixels.

139
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:05,340
So rounded corners is very important.

140
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:10,730
And it's a trend that has been continuing for a number of years and shows no signs of letting up.

141
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,900
So you can see just by rounding that corner, it looks a lot more modern.

142
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:19,400
The second thing is using box shadow.

143
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,520
So it provides a shadow to elements.

144
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,700
In this case, our d'Hiv.

145
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:32,080
And that allows it to look like the element itself is kind of floating on the page.

146
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:36,070
So there are a couple different values we're going to need to enter here.

147
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:38,950
The first one is horizontal offset.

148
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:42,280
So that means a shadow is going to go left or right of the element.

149
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:44,060
We actually don't want any of that.

150
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,880
We just want a vertical shadow.

151
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,490
So just a shadow directly below the object.

152
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:56,290
So the vertical offset, we're gonna set at 15 pixels and the next property is referred to as Blur.

153
00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:00,310
And this is the amount of opacity added to the shadow.

154
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:04,600
So if you had a value of zero here, it would make it a solid color.

155
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,470
Of course, we don't want that.

156
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:07,930
We want it to be very subtle.

157
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:10,690
So we're gonna give that a big value of 30 pixels.

158
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:16,720
The next value is the spread value, which determines how far out from the element.

159
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:20,320
The shadow is, again, because we want it to be subtle.

160
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,850
We're gonna set that at five pixels so it's not too far away from the object.

161
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:32,430
The very last thing is we're gonna set the color and we're gonna use an RGV a value and we're gonna

162
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,220
use black.

163
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,690
So zero zero zero.

164
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:40,030
And then the A stands for Alpha, which can also be thought of as opacity.

165
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:42,580
And we're gonna make that zero point three.

166
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,570
So that makes it.

167
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:47,910
30 percent of the black color.

168
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:49,090
So it's kind of See-Through.

169
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:50,170
All right.

170
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,440
So let's save that and check it out.

171
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:56,250
OK, so you see what I mean about the shadow here.

172
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:01,170
It looks like it's kind of coming off the page, but it's very, very subtle.

173
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:03,810
I think that looks a whole lot better.

174
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,630
I hope that you feel the same way about that.

175
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,030
And I hope that you enjoyed this quick tip.

176
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:13,500
Next, we're going to start trying to tame our image here.

177
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:18,750
Next thing is we're going to try to tame our image here and we're going to use an approach that would

178
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:22,830
allow you to put in an image of any size and have it fit properly.

179
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:26,670
So this is through using something called object fit.

180
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:32,970
So you can see that we have a whitespace here of a rectangle, but we see that this image does not fill

181
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,810
this space.

182
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:40,830
If we switch to fill, we can see that it fills the space, but it distorts the image.

183
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:47,520
We're actually going to use this option object fit cover, which allows it to fill the space but not

184
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,720
distort the image.

185
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:55,020
So that's what will allow you to put in any size image and it will just fill the space properly.

186
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:59,200
OK, so let's jump to our see, assess and figure that out.

187
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,240
OK, so you can see that we already have some styling within our image container.

188
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:07,530
We're going to need now to set the height and width.

189
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,300
So first, I'm going to make it a square.

190
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:16,430
So I'm just going to have a height of three hundred pixels and a width of 300 pixels.

191
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:20,570
Of course, I want it to be smaller than the width of our overall container.

192
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:25,760
And you can see that it'll have 50 pixels on the left and then 50 pixels on the right.

193
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,950
That's how we're going to center it within our player.

194
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:29,480
Container.

195
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,860
And the next thing is below our image container.

196
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:39,230
We're gonna actually need to do some styling for the image within our image container.

197
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:40,920
So let's do that.

198
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:43,040
Below image container.

199
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:46,810
And we want to target the image element inside.

200
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,720
And we're going to set this height to be 100 percent.

201
00:12:52,930 --> 00:13:00,190
And the with to be 100 percent as well, because the container is setting the hard pixel value and we're

202
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:04,030
just using this to have the image fill the container.

203
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:09,250
And, of course, we can add the object fit cover as well.

204
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,690
Like I just explained.

205
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:14,380
And we also want to add border radius and box shadow.

206
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:16,210
So I'll actually copy this.

207
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:21,770
But this time, we want the box shadow to be a little bit more subtle.

208
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:27,200
So instead of 15 pixels for a vertical offset, it's going gonna change it to five.

209
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:29,540
OK, so let's save that.

210
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,270
And check it out.

211
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,820
OK, maybe you want that to be a little bit darker.

212
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:39,800
So you know what, I can increase this from zero point three to zero point five.

213
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:41,400
OK.

214
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,810
So that's looking really, really nice.

215
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,650
Perfect.

216
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:49,600
But let's have a look at the mobile view and see what that looks like.

217
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:58,920
OK, so we can see that we're in the mobile view for an iPhone X and we can see that our container is

218
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:05,250
not fitting because the width of an iPhone is three hundred and seventy five pixels and the width of

219
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:07,860
our player container is 400 pixels.

220
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:12,390
So we're gonna need to change that value in order to make that work.

221
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:15,100
So let's jump back to our C assess.

222
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:21,750
And if we scroll to the bottom, this is always where you want your media queries because you want it

223
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,180
to override anything else above.

224
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:25,950
You want this to have the last word.

225
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:34,890
And we're gonna target our player container and we're just going to change the width to be ninety five.

226
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,540
V.

227
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,250
W.

228
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:44,480
So that means ninety five percent of the screen with meaning that it'll have 2.5 percent of the screen

229
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,150
with margin on the left and right side.

230
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,880
And you can see that specifically.

231
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:55,700
I already made this media query for iPhone vertical and the max width is three hundred and seventy six

232
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,300
pixels.

233
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:00,530
So anything less than that will be controlled by this media query.

234
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:04,460
Of course, our iPhones are three hundred and seventy five pixels.

235
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,810
Let's jump back and check that out.

236
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:07,740
OK.

237
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:08,240
Perfect.

238
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:11,860
So everything is now fitting in our iPhone size.

239
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:12,500
Awesome.

240
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,140
If you have any issues with this.

241
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:17,830
Sometimes a dev tools a little bit finicky.

242
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:22,100
You might have to click responsive and then go back down to the size that you want.

243
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:27,260
In this case, also, the audio element controls might cause some issues.

244
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:32,510
So try just deleting this element and it'll show that the layout is working fine.

245
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:38,150
Don't worry about deleting this because this actually won't be part of the UI of our final project.

246
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:39,410
All right.

247
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,920
So everything's looking really great so far for our layout.

248
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:47,840
Let's take a break here and we'll build out the rest of the UI in the next one.

249
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:49,280
I'll see you then.

250
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,270
Bye for now.
